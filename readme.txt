== Description ==

Templastic is a fully responsive theme, which means it will be displayed perfectly on the screens of all sizes. This way, people can access your website using any device possible - be it a PC, a smartphone, or a tablet. Templastic is a fresh minimalistic theme with a clean and simplistic, and yet highly elegant design. It will be a killer option for a business website or WordPress blog. 

Although Templastic is well-rounded as such, there is always room for some more functionality improvement. Therefore, we made this theme perfectly compatible with our products, so that you will not have to struggle with any conflicts between the theme and the plugins. Such plugins as Captcha (http://wordpress.org/plugins/captcha/) and Gallery (http://wordpress.org/plugins/gallery-plugin/) will add a handful of practical features to your website.

== Theme Notes ==

= Slider =

To activate a slider, you need to select the posts, which will be displayed in the slider. Without these posts, the slider as such will not be displayed. To add an image to the slider, please go to the Admin panel (wp-admin) => "Posts," and click "Add new." Then upload the image by hitting "Add featured image." 
Notice: For correct slider work, the image should be no less that 940px large in width and 307px in height. 
In the "Slider" field, please check the box "Add this post to the slider, mark it." Please save the post (click "Publish"), and voila - you have just added a new slide to the slider. 
In case there is a single slide added to the slider, the latter will be displayed as a static image. You can add as many images to the slider as you wish. 
The slider is located on the main page, and it consists of three parts: title (heading), brief description (a part of the post text) and an image (thumbnail). 

= Post Thumbnail Functionality =

For post thumbnails, we recommend using the image no less than 503 px. large in width, if the post was not added to the slider. Otherwise, the image should be larger than 940 px. in width and 307 px. in height.

= Post Formats: Aside =

Templastic Wordpress theme only supports these post formats. Please style them in a certain way. Other post formats will be displayed as regular posts.
